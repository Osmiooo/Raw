Welcome to the Raw mod! 
This mod adds raw items and blocks for every ore that doesn't have one, that includes:

  Raw Coal
  Raw Coal Block
  Raw Lapis-Lazuli
  Raw Lapis-Lazuli Block
  Raw Redstone
  Raw Redstone Block
  Raw Diamond
  Raw Diamond Block
  Raw Emerald
  Raw Emerald Block
  
You will obtain the items when breaking the ore, you can smelt them to get the ore and you can use 9 raw items to craft a raw block. 
So yes, you need to smelt raw coal with wood to obtain coal. 
It also adds a new advancement called "Raw to the Core!" which you can obtain if you have all 8 raw ores in your inventory at the same time. 
This mod is for Minecraft 1.19, only for Fabric. I will update to 1.19.1 when it releases.
